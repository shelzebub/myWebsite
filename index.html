                            <p>
                                As I stepped out of high school into my adult life, I didn't know that slowly, my lack of planning and direction would become 
                                my greatest obstacle. I first attended SFU in pursuit of medical school as my dad is a dentist and my role model. I didn't 
                                enjoy my time at SFU. I lacked friends and motivation. Studying general sciences was honestly really fun but it just wasn't for me.
                                In my third year, I took some computer science courses and wow, I got really into it. Unfortunately I wasn't prepared for the
                                difficulties that came ahead and ended up dropping out of school. Devasted, I attended Douglas College to improve my grades in the 
                                hopes of re-entering SFU.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I did a lot better at Douglas, took some Earth Science courses and felt more focused. I poured my all into studying hard and being 
                                a good student. In the end, I couldn't bring myself to reapply for SFU. I was just so scared to fail again. From there, I found 
                                work at a sushi restaurant.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I spent a good two years at Tobiko Sushi. It was a fast paced environment with lots of challenges. I started off as a kitchen helper 
                                and quickly moved my way up the ranks. It started with preparing raw ingredients, working with a partner, to making the orders on
                                my own. In a short few months, I got the opportunity to work in the sushi bar; preparing ingredients, filleting fish, making rolls,
                                sashimi, and interacting with customer. It was a great experience and all but I started to think about SFU again. Not the school 
                                itself, but the feeling I had when I stepped into the world of computing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Day after day, I thought about how much I was scared to fail. I was doing well at the restaurant. My co-workers liked me, my boss 
                                liked me, the waitresses liked me. But I wasn't happy with myself. I still came back to the thought of "What if I can be a programmer?" 
                                I remembered back in high school, a lot of my class mates were talking about a place to study computer science and BCIT came to mind. 
                                In my free time, I researched what it means to be a software developer. Should I do it? Am I ready? Will I be able to make it out this 
                                time? All I could think about was "I want to go to BCIT. I want to be a programmer. I want to do what I love." And from there, I applied
                                to BCIT Computer Systems Technology Program and began my journey as a Software Developer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The two years I spent at BCIT are probably the best two years of my life thus far. I really didn't know much going into BCIT, but what 
                                I got out of it was crazy. I made websites, I made mobile apps, I made friends :D and of course, became more attuned with who I wanted
                                to be. There are so many different areas of computing it was quite overwelming. I chose to specialize in Information Systems and graduated 
                                with Distinction. Although my time at BCIT was short, I gained a lot of skills, both technical and interpersonal. There were presentations, 
                                term projects, assignments, exams, client meetings, all-nighters, partying, stressing, sometimes losing my mind here and there. But all of 
                                this contributed to the shaping of who I am today. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My goal as a developer is to always become better at what I am doing. Since computer science is an ever-expanding subject, my learning will 
                                never end. I hope all of my current and future projects will bring me in the direction of greatness; providing people everywhere with joy 
                                and utilities through the use of technology. Here's to an exciting future! 
                            </p>
                            <p class="gold-text">

                            <p>
                                I went to school, dropped out, went to another school, quit, worked at a sushi bar, quit, went to BCIT, graduated as a Software Developer, 
                                and now working towards a future where I can make things happen.
